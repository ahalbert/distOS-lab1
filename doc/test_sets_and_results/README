1. This test file test.py is used to verify the correctness of each function. It also shows the cost time for the functions. The output file is test.out
2. We also did test for verifying the synchronization, through adding the time.sleep(1) after each request (you should first uncomment time.sleep in ./src/server/server.py for running the test). The implementation is test_sync.py. No output! You can simply run the script to see the result. For the result, 'True' is the return of incrementMedalTally (write), while 'list structure' is the return of getMedalTally (read). The result verifies write has higher priviledge than read, and all reads start at the same time
